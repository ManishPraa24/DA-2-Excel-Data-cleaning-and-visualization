# DA-2-Excel-Data-cleaning-and-visualization
Data of bike sales of North America, Europe and Pacific countries in excel worksheet file was cleaned using filters and excel formulas. Further, it was visualized using Excel charts and Pivot tables.

Data was taken from a course of Data Analyst on youtube, freecodecamp.org (Alex the Analyst).


# What I did to clean and visualize data?
1. Created a new worksheet named 'Working sheet' and copied the data into it.
2. Added filters and checked for unwanted or values which were not syncing with data given.
3. Replaced misguiding letters to the specific meaning word (e.g. 'M' to 'Male', etc.)
4. Created a new worksheet named 'Pivot table' for creating Pivot tables and their respective bar graphs.
5. Pivot tables created : i) Average Income of Male and Female vs Bike purchases
                         ii) Distance Commute vs Bike purchases
                        iii) Age group vs Bike purchases
                         iv) Age vs Bike purchases
6. Created the bar graphs of above pivot tables from recommended charts.
7. Created new worksheet named 'Graphs' and styled it accordingly to display the graphs.
8. Added slicers of Region, Marital status, Education and Occupation which changes the graphs' data according to the changes in selection of values from those slicers.
9. Connected every slicer to all the pivot table graphs using 'Report connections' feature.
